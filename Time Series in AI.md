### **4. Machine Learning for Time Series**
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Lag-based features, rolling window features.
  - Date/time features (day of the week, month, quarter).
  - Encoding seasonality patterns.

- **ML Models for Time Series**:
  - Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).
  - Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV` or `Optuna`.

---

### **5. Deep Learning for Time Series**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**:
  - Vanilla RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).
  - Applications for sequential data.

- **Sequence Models**:
  - Encoder-Decoder architectures.
  - Attention mechanism for time series.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
  - 1D CNN for time series feature extraction.

- **Transformer Models**:
  - Learn Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), and its advantages over RNNs.
