I'll provide some advanced real-world applications of feature extraction with practical examples.


1. **Bag of Visual Words (BoVW)**
```python
histogram = extractor.extract_bow_features('image.jpg')
```
Used in:
- Product image classification
- Visual search engines
- Scene recognition
- Content-based image retrieval

1. **Real-time Object Detection**
```python
extractor.detect_object_realtime('template.jpg')
```
Applications:
- Manufacturing quality control
- Assembly line inspection
- Robotic vision systems
- Security surveillance

1. **Facial Landmark Detection**
```python
result_img, landmarks = extractor.facial_landmark_detection('face.jpg')
```
Used in:
- Face recognition systems
- Emotion detection
- AR filters (like Snapchat/Instagram)
- Driver monitoring systems
