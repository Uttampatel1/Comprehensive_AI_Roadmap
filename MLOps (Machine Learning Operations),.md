Here's a comprehensive roadmap to learning MLOps (Machine Learning Operations):

---

### **Stage 1: Fundamentals**
1. **Programming Skills**
   - Learn Python thoroughly (focus on libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.).
   - Understand software engineering best practices: modularity, testing, debugging, and version control.

2. **Machine Learning Basics**
   - Study the basics of ML algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning).
   - Get hands-on with basic ML frameworks like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
   - Learn to preprocess and clean data.

3. **DevOps Basics**
   - Understand basic DevOps practices (CI/CD pipelines, containerization).
   - Learn Docker and Kubernetes.
   - Familiarize yourself with Linux commands and shell scripting.

### **Stage 2: Intermediate Knowledge**
4. **Data Engineering**
   - Learn to work with ETL pipelines.
   - Get comfortable with SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
   - Learn data workflow orchestration tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect.

5. **Model Deployment**
   - Understand different deployment strategies: REST APIs, batch predictions, and streaming.
   - Learn to use Flask, FastAPI, or Django for serving ML models.
   - Get familiar with tools like TensorFlow Serving and TorchServe.

6. **Cloud Platforms**
   - Learn cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
   - Focus on AI/ML services (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform).
   - Understand cloud storage and compute services.

### **Stage 3: Advanced Skills**
7. **MLOps Tools**
   - Experiment with MLOps frameworks:
     - **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases
     - **Model Versioning**: DVC, MLflow
     - **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
   - Learn about feature stores (Feast, Tecton).

8. **CI/CD for ML**
   - Build automated pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.
   - Integrate ML models with CI/CD workflows.

9. **Model Monitoring & Feedback**
   - Learn to monitor model drift and performance degradation.
   - Work with tools like EvidentlyAI, Seldon Core, or Alibi.

### **Stage 4: Specialized Knowledge**
10. **Distributed Systems for ML**
    - Learn distributed training using frameworks like Horovod, Ray, or TensorFlow Distributed.
    - Understand distributed data storage systems (Hadoop, Spark, etc.).

11. **Advanced Topics**
    - Explore A/B testing and experimentation in ML.
    - Understand ethical AI practices and fairness in ML models.
    - Study secure and compliant ML operations (GDPR, HIPAA compliance).

12. **Case Studies and Real-World Projects**
    - Deploy end-to-end ML pipelines in real-world projects.
    - Study real-world applications of MLOps (e.g., recommendation systems, fraud detection).
